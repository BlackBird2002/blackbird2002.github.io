						<h3>The legend of Zelda Link's awakening remake</h3>

						<h3>The legend of Zelda Ocarina of time</h3>
						<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is the fifth episode of The Legend of Zelda series, five years after The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, and is the first game in 3d.</p>
						<p>Ocarina of Time tells the story of Link, a young boy living in a village lost in the forest, who travels the kingdom of Hyrule to prevent Ganondorf from obtaining the Triforce, a sacred relic divided into three: courage (Link), wisdom (Zelda) and strength (Ganondorf). The Triforce, once gathered, gives its holder superhuman powers. The main antagonist of the game, Ganondorf, wants it in order to rule the world. Therefore, Link will have to travel through time with his ocarina and find the seven sages that will allow him to lock Ganondorf in a dimensional seal.</p>

						</div>	
						<h3>The legend of Zelda Majora's mask</h3>
						<p>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The sixth game in The Legend of Zelda franchise and the second in three dimensions after Ocarina of Time.</p>
						<p>It features improved graphics and several gameplay changes compared to its predecessor, although a number of elements and character models are reused, a choice caused by time constraints. The Nintendo 64 version of the game requires the use of the Expansion Pak, an accessory that increases the memory capacity of the system and allows for better quality graphics. The game introduces several innovative concepts based on an ever-recurring three-day time cycle and the use of masks to transform the protagonist, Link, into different creatures. Link learns numerous melodies on the ocarina that allow him to control time streams or open passages to temples. The game features the characteristic gameplay of the Zelda series, which consists of successfully traversing temples composed of several dungeon rooms containing puzzles of varying complexity to solve and enemies to defeat.</p>
						<p>Majora's Mask takes place in Termina, a parallel universe to Hyrule, which a giant falling moon threatens to destroy after three days, unless the player manages to avoid the impending catastrophe. The main antagonist is Skull Kid, who has stolen a powerful ancient relic, the "Mask of Majora," from an enigmatic mask seller. Skull Kid uses his newfound powers from the mask to rip the moon from its orbit and gradually bring it down to Termina, where it is to crash 72 hours later. At the request of the salesman, Link tries to go back in time several times with the help of a magic ocarina to recover the mask and prevent the apocalypse. On his journey, he collects unique masks by helping the people of Termina, which grant him a variety of abilities, including shape-shifting.</p>

						<h3>The legend of Zelda Oracle of ages</h3>
						<p>The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages (or simply Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages) are two action-adventure games. They are the seventh and eighth episodes of The Legend of Zelda series.</p>
						<p>The player controls the character named Link, moves him in a world map in top view and fights monsters, solves puzzles and progresses his character thanks to different items he finds or obtains.</p>
						<p>Link must find different items by exploring the map, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. In Oracle of Seasons, Link finds himself in the land of Holodrum where he sees the dark general Onox kidnap Din, the Oracle of Seasons. In Oracle of Ages, Link finds himself in Labrynna where the witch Veran possesses the spirit of Nayru, the Oracle of Ages. The main plot is revealed when the player finishes both games. The main items are the Rod of Seasons, which controls the seasons in Holodrum, and the Harp of the Ages, which allows Link to travel through time in Labrynna. Before Link can infiltrate Onox’s Castle and Veran Tower, he must obtain the eight essences of nature and the eight essences of time, which are hidden and guarded in the dungeons and protected by bosses. A code provided by one of the games, allows in the other to continue the quest and vice versa.</p>
