			<h3>Link</h3>
			<p>Link is a fictional character and the protagonist of Nintendo's video game series The Legend of Zelda. Link was introduced as the hero of the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game and has appeared in a total of 19 entries in the series, as well as a number of spin-offs. Common elements in the series include Link travelling through Hyrule whilst exploring dungeons, battling creatures, and solving puzzles until he eventually defeats the series' primary antagonist, Ganon, and saves Princess Zelda.</p>

			<h3>Zelda</h3>
			<p>Hylian princess, she is the daughter of the king of Hyrule and the heir of the kingdom. She is the future of the kingdom threatened by Ganon, who tries to harm her. Her appearance evolves over the episodes (like her eye color, often blue), with hair successively brown, red then blond, however her dress remains pink (except in Twilight Princess, where she is rather lavender, and in Breath of the Wild where her tunic is light blue). Like Link, Zelda is not always the same, since she becomes each time one of her own descendants and thus the heir to the crown.</p>

			<h3>Ganon/Ganondorf</h3>
			<p>He is one of the Gerudo men who are born every hundred years. His full name is Ganondorf Dragmire, but he is better known as Mandrag Ganon - which means "Ganon of the Enchanted Thieves" according to the booklet included in the box of A Link to the Past. He appears in every Zelda episode except Majora's Mask, The Minish Cap and Four Swords. In Skyward Sword, we can guess him as the Avatar of the Void, which would be his first incarnation. He usually uses his Triforce fragment to try to realize his desires. In order to achieve his goals, he kidnaps Princess Zelda several times to prevent her from exercising her power over the kingdom of Hyrule. He is associated with the Triforce of the Force.</p>
			<p>He sometimes appears in another form and changes his name to Ganon. In this form, he looks like a boar, sometimes bipedal (A Link to the Past, Oracle of Ages/Seasons, Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess). This form is his demonic or animal form, while Ganondorf is his human form. He also appears in Link's Awakening, where he is one of the final boss phases.</p>
			<p>Ganon or Ganondorf sometimes appears under other forms. Indeed, in The Wind Waker, Ganon creates Alter-Ganon, a giant puppet in the image of Ganon. He also creates in different episodes ghosts of himself as Ganon Spectral.</p>
